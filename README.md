# AlgoSync

AlgoSync is an interactive web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides a visualization platform for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Users can visualize the inner workings of various DSA algorithms through dynamic and easy-to-understand animations. The goal of this platform is to make learning and understanding DSA concepts more intuitive and engaging.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch algorithms in action with animations for different data structures and sorting/searching algorithms.
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to step through the algorithm's process and see how data structures evolve over time.
- **Algorithm Library**: Includes common algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Binary Search**, **DFS**, **BFS**, and more.
- **Tailwind-based UI**: Clean, responsive, and modern design powered by Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The language powering the interactive features.
- **React Router**: For smooth navigation between different algorithm visualizations and pages.
- **Webpack/Babel**: For bundling and transpiling the codebase.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. You can verify if they're installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoSync.git
   cd AlgoSync
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Use npm to install all necessary packages:

   ```bash8
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   Start the application locally:
